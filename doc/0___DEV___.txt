web workers work on copied info, so keep game data lean and in separate chunks
using DOM only means we can possible do offline mode. webgl will prohibit this.
have AI plan turns while user takes their own turn.

SANDBOX:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
there should be no "Stock" races. this adds to the eXploration. 
- technological progression speed as a startup option
- random events: set two pins to determine the type of events you want
	- Catastrophic
	- Damaging
	- Normal
	- Helpful
	- Advantageous
- counters to giant fleets: area of effect weapons, chain-lightning
- counters to expansionism - HFOG?
- population's resistance to takovers:
	- local culture, government
	- "they will view us as liberators!"
	- morale
	- takeover of homeworld - defend at all costs - extremely hard to acquire.
- research: putting all RPs in a single field: diminishing results
- racepick: specialized / adaptable (influences production and economy)
- percentage of tech tree as a startup option (you need "Tech duplicity" for this to work, lots of techs)
- full/partial blockade
- buy/sell ships or techs like real nations selling jets and missiles. Open markets.
- multi-option planetary specials (choose how to exploit it)
- category targetted bombing
- learning AI: record a player's profile over several games
- global morale? (cassus belli?)
- Babylon to Daniel: welcome other races for their benefits -> reduce reprogramming time for conquered citizens.
- food types? (plant, microbial, mechanical, mineral / crystal, photosynthetic / self-creating)
- joint techs: some techs in grab bag only available if another field is researched already.
	example: Plasma Physics grab bag yields Plasma Cutter Mining if Terraforming Engineering is researched.
- techs: broad effect versus deep effect.
- multiple kinds of shielding / weapon:
	- Energy (raw power)
	- Gravity
	- Projectile (mass driver)
	- ???
- ground combat: tactical options limited by government and technology
- some types of infrastructure can be more resistant to bombing (bard of prey)
- ships can be destroyed during construction (raids, sabotage)
- traffic models for minerals / government / food / supply train
- education?
- trade embargos as a means of punishment
- supply and demand - alien markets and contacts
- side effects for racial-policies (extra army protection required, decreased productivity, etc)
- missile range: 1, 2, 3 stage rockets
- variable sound effects: laser sound with different pitches, all masquerading as a Sound*
- alerts (!) above planets, or possibly as stackable set of icons on the side of the screen.







QUESTIONS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- How are armies created and transported?
- Are ground assaults multi-turn?
- Should space combat be multi-planet or single planet?
- Supply trains for fleets?
- how are planetary items built (defenses, shipyards, etc)?
- ground combat: land vs air, etc???









RACES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options \/----------------\/

Body: Organic, Inorganic, Semibiotic (effects food required and cannibalism)
Primary Habitat: Subterranian, Land, Sea, Air (effects ground combat and available space on planets)
Morality: Amoral (none), Loose, Strict (affects interaction with other races, interaction options)

research patterns: if using randomly generated techs, techs will have more side effects, positive/negative. Stupider races have more negative impacts.



Races \/----------------\/

- "Comos" (blobs)
	+ Biology research
	++ Ground Combat
	-- research
	- diplo
	++ growth rate
	+ planetary tolerance
	= Semibiotic
	= natural lack of communication abilities - possibly completely

- "Metol" (fully robotic)
	= Inorganic
	+ Weapons / Physics / Engineering research
	-- other research
	+ industry
	= cheap ships
	= fulltime collective government (Central Intelligence?)
	+ ground combat
	+++ planetary tolerance
	-- biology research

- (Soft-Core Cyborg) - Empracyd
	= honorable
	+ diplo
	+ research
	= Semibiotic

- (Hard-Core Cyborg, think "Virus") - Aryracyd
	= Semibiotic
	- Nasty!
	+ research
	+ engineering, industry
	+ cheap ships?

- (original father-of-cyborg race)
	["Padredel" (spanish), "Paido" (portuguese), "Padredi" (italian), "Votervon" (german)]
	= Organic

- (aquatic winged eyeball things) lilliat

- (pit monster)

- "Alitorocha" (rock-based, "Alito" Italian for breath, "rocha" portuguese for rock)
	= Inorganic
	-- growth rate

- (water-based?)
	= Inorganic
	-- growth rate

- (etherean?) Blovarian

- Heavy-G Slug Race







ECONOMY:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where does money come from?
	- Taxes on people on planets
		- more affluent people pay more taxes (possibly morale = tax boost?)
		- planets doing more internal business trading pay more taxes
		- starlane connections may effect tax revenue.
			- starlane costs cancel out tax income then ???
	- Spoils of War (Rome)
	- Government sponsored sale of surplus goods
		- Military units
		- Technology
		- Worlds - colonize or claim a planet that would be of use to another civ!
		- Food
		- Minerals
	- Terrifs on Trade agreements - possible way to use embargoes
	- Sell bonds for quick cash
	- Buy-it-now options, like galciv
	
- Hyperlane connections and physical makeup of systems determine abstracted business traffic.
	- Connections to other civs increase inter-civ traffic (higher trade + terrifs = money)
		- must have connections to initiate trade
	- Connections between planets increase per-capita income (+taxes)
	- More planets per system = +taxes through increases private trade and business
	- Materials rating(?)

- Traffic and blockading:
	- arm civilian freighters to reduce power of blockades (costs money - make a policy?).
	- freighter traffic: direct thoroughfare or webwork?
	- blockaded systems prevent starlane movement
	- ships need tech to get past blockades (cloaking)

- Taxes: subtracted from EVERTHING on a planet.

- resources should not be exchangeable through money:
	i.e. excess food -> money -> RPs

- money is an abstraction of the exchange of goods and services.

- "commerce" translates excess industry / minerals into cash.

- Economic warfare: exchange rates and inflation

- Larger empires are more expensive to run.

- Govt costs money.

- Maintenance of ships and other shings: costs Industry points!

- Employed Population + Infrastructure = Production

- Food effects growth rate. More surplus = more pop growth.

- Infrastructure requires maintainance?

- Food: If food < pop, pop--, else pop++

Catagories:
	- Remember: each catagory needs a +/- mod effected by the planet for best results!

	- Industry (gravity)
	- Materials (richness)
	- Research (???)
	- Government (???)
	- Agriculture (environment)
	- Commerce (hyperlane connections? Colonized planets in system?)

- Special Resources:
	- Pharmecuticals (pop growth)
	- (weapons + physics)
	- (defense)

	- Terran-prefering races obviously have more leeway, so race picks should cost more the closer to center you get on the two sliders -OR- make planets rarer the closer to the center of the matrix you get. Age of galaxy could effect planet types available

	- Gravity
		- gravity usually follows size, so high-grav races will have more land available so large planets should be outnumbered by smaller planets (?)

	- Size

	- bio-richness (farming)

	- Latitude - amount of habitability leeway a race has. Diminishing returns.
		- 50 pts is the normal latitude
		-

	- rate habitability by simple percentage or will that be Breadth-Effect limiting?
		i.e. "Habitability: 67%"

	- dimishing returns graph :
		y = 100-((0.05*x)^4)

		If you want Y to be zero at a specific point along X, then the point is A:
		0 = 100 - ( (a*x) ^ 4)
		(a*x) ^ 4 = 100
		a * x = 100^(1/4)
		a = ( 100^(1/4) ) / x

		| boiled down, it looks like this:
		|
		| Effect (effect)
		| Planet Habitability (H)
		| Racial Max Latitude (max_latitude)
		| Coefficient (c)
		|
		| ---> c = ( 100^(1/4) ) / max_latitude
		|
		| ---> effect = 100 - (c*H)^4

		[!] There needs to be two technological variables:
			1) Adaptability: Habitat Latitude (max latitude, coefficient in equation)
				- this increases the territories you could potentially settle
			2) Specialization: Effective Use of Habitat (exponant in equation)
				- this makes better use of territories you already have



Habitation v.2:

Policies:
	- cultural policies (per culture or race): [these can also be empire-wide / cost money]
		- Persecute
		- Hinder
		- Tolerate (neutral)
		- Promote
		- Bless
	- Movement policies:
		- Movement tax (?) (+tax, -immigration)
		- Mass Exodus - evacuate everyone NOW (-$$$)
		- Taxes
		- Tourism / Advertising (-$$$, +immigration)
	- Deportation
	- Annihilation
	- Cannibalize
	- Iron Curtain

	- policies require military or govt presence?

Preset Growth Curves:
	- Industrial, Material, Economic, Research, Farming, Administration (govt)
	- Fast-Track (infrastructure++ ASAP)
	- Pop-Growth
	- Normal
	- Defense
	- AI (let the computer decide for you. Computer may change template and re-specialize)

[!] 	Tie a planet to a curve. If the curve changes, all planets tied to it change!


- pop growth is a result of current population, planet type, and maybe policies

- Rate planets as % of total infrastructural potential
	- use as goal markers: "planets past 50% build XYZ object"

- Special Resources:
	-> Link resources with advanced tech families: Plasma, Neutron, etc...
	- Plasma Conducting Crystals
	- Pharmecuticals
	- "Mana"

MOVEMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Hyperlanes are created through HyperGate technologies. Both systems require a gate, but afterwards a lane needs to be built from one to the other. Both colonies can build lanes towards each other and the effect is cumulative.
- Hyperlanes do not exist at game start
- Hyperlanes are created when two systems both have a Hypergate or better built and at least one of the planets builds a Hyperlane to the other system (as a build project).
- Hyperlanes cannot be built towards systems that have no Hypergate mk.I or better (receiving end).
- HyperGate mk.1-5 allows Hyperlane levels 1-5 to be built.

- movement is in decimals

CULTURES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Some cultures are not selectable as primary cultures at the beginning of the game. They are rarer but potentially better / worse than the regular cultures

? Is culture different than race picks?

Types:
	- Fatalist
		pushovers
		low revolt
		abusable!
		low conversion rate
	- Barbarian
		-Peacetime Moral
		-Peacetime Production
		+Wartime Moral
		+Wartime Production

		high conversion rate
	- Adventurist
		+immigration
		+tech
	- Supremesist
		xenophobic / -mixed races moral
		+war
	- Romantic (Artist)
		+ morale


GOVERNMENTS:
----------------------------------------------------

- governments are created from various policies instead of selected wholesale?

- government affects what things cost (bureacracy, fraud)

- governments require global level of Government infrastructure to do well.
	- diminishing returns, bell curve, ideal level
	- different government, different levels
	- planets influenced by local govt, system govt, global govt

- Governments can be promoted - like a class system

- different governments are limited/priviledged in actions
	- deportation/annihilation - warlike govt's
	- bless/persecute policies not for democracy
	- going to war without declaration
	- stabbing players in the back => minus points morale / diplo

- Collection and use of taxes differs based on type.
	- X: Anarchy - taxes collected depends on morale
	- X: Hive: taxes does not affect morale (much)
	- X: Some types eat up money through cooruption or beaurocracy nonsense
	
Governments progress through stages. Beginning stages may be outright bad. laer stages may be awesome (or vice versa)

* changes and upgrades in govt make a lot of people upset. You can potentionally get a "bad take" which can tank your empire.

Types:

	- feudalism

	Personal Freedoms
		- Democracy - good for small empire only
		- Republic (basic non-monarchy type, uses group of people)
		- Federation (unification of smaller parties)
		- Imperial Democracy (vote on a king every X years, king sole power)

	Equality
		- Socialism
		- Collective
		- Hive

	Top-Down
		- Monarchy
		- Constitutional Monarchy <-- consider just having two levels. why not?
		- Empire

	Economic
		- Timocracy (only property owners)
		- Plutocracy (rule by wealthy)
		- Econocracy (buy stock in government)
		- Corpocracy / Corporatism / Corporation / Corporationism (rule by corporations)
		- Stellar Franchisement
	
	Qualified
		- Bureaucracy
		- Meritocracy (rule by the qualified)
		- Mastership (concentrated gurus) / Synarchy (secret elite)

	Military
		- Authoritarianism (control of people without consent)
		- Totalitarianism (control all aspects of life)
		- Stratocracy / Despotism (military)

	Lawlessness
		- Anarchy
		- Adhocracy - absence of hierarchy, opposite of bureaucracy. All members of an organization have the authority to make decisions and to take actions affecting the future of the organization.
		- Cryptocracy - rulers are secret. this improves continuity and security. makes spying difficult.
		
		
		
TECHNOLOGY:
------------------------------------

- Classic Model
	You have "fields" and "techs" inside those fields. You research a tech at a specific level and then that opens up the next level and batch of techs. This model can take the form of a list, matrix, or tree and can split the difference between applied and theoretical techs (like MOO3) or not (like MOO1+2). Either way, it's a pretty straight-forward and familiar system.
	+ easy to understand
	+ easily documented
	- boring. Done by every 4x game EVAR
	- very linear / predictable
	- easily exploited

- "Use Makes It Better" model
	Research goes into basic fields and produces "base techs". Base techs can be improved through direct game usage. The more you use it, the more advanced versions of itself it opens up. Advanced versions may cost more upfront and may need to be prototyped before cost/effect becomes reasonable for the tech to implemented on a wider scale. This system models "practical experience" as a research enhancer.
	+ totally player controlled.
	+ fosters strategic forethought
	- high micromanagement potential unless near-fully automated (which would be proportionally boring)
	- Applies most readily to Military apps, not so much Civil apps (like, uh... [i]half the game[/i]).
	= might be employed for certain techs only (military ones)

- Randomly Generated "Template Techs" Model
	The entire tech tree/list/whatever is randomly generated and/or generated on the fly. Techs are divided into very basic template "stubs" like Beam Weapon, Armor, Farm, Factory. Each template has a number of mods, parameters, and features that can be tinkered with. Random generation of the tech tree is made possible by simply modifying the parameter list of a basic tech template and giving it a cute name.
	+ never-ending tech tree/list/whatever
	+ different every game, possibly different even for [i]every race[/i] in every game at no extra cost.
	- lacks personality
	- makes "special feature" techs difficult to implement. Gameplay would consequently be pretty straight forward.

- Magic 8-Ball Model
	Bards model. Research is only directed by the primary fields. Which individual techs you get are unknown -OR- unknown up to a certain point at which they are seen. Techs can then be "dumped" for a different "grab-bag attempt" or fully researched.
	+ less likely to be exploitable.
	- minimal player direction - frustrating!?
	- not very realistic
	- no strategy?

- Lev's Tech-Families Model
	RPs are split between Theoretical and Applied columns. Theoretical research into the basic fields (Physics, Biology, Engineering, ...) produces researchable "tech families" which are then placed into the Applied column. Putting RPs into a tech family in the applied column yields semi-random individual techs related to the family. Example: Theoretical Research in Physics yields "Plasma Physics." Putting Applied research into "Plasma Physics" may yield "Plasma Cannon", "Plasma Rifle", "Plasma Power Plant", etc, and subsequent upgrades and modifications thereof. Certain techs in the family and/or upgrades thereof may be contingent upon research in other families. (i.e. "Plasma Power Plant mkIII" in the "Plasma Physics" family may require research in the "Energy Containment" family first). Which techs you get from a family can be modified with a MILITARY<->CIVIL slider, but are still semi-random (up for debate)
	+ some randomness (maybe), but not enough to "get in the way"
	+ good balance between variety (breadth) and power (depth) of techs.
	- game requires techs to be grouped into families. Families must be fairly well distributed or the game will be unbalanced.
	- doesn't [i]directly[/i] incorporate "Use Makes It Better" ideology (i really like the concept if it can be made to work)


"So far, this doesn't incorporate the "use makes it better" ideas we have been discussing earlier, but i'm thinking this may already be in the game anyway. Consider this: When you go into battle with Antimatter Beam mkII and it makes nary a dent on the enemy, you just used your tech and found out it doesn't work. This isn't a game mechanism, it's an actual player experience. You then decide to either research Plasma technologies or press on to get Armor Piercing mods for the Antimatter beam. "

"I think you are getting close to a solution when you suggested "side effects" in other unrelated fields. For instance, a tech could put a dent in industry, cost a lot more, take more people to make, etc. But it would be hard to come up with suitable side effects for the majority of civil technologies, especially if they are many. "
